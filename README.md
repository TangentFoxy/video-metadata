# Video Metadata
After [YouTube threatened me for linking to the New York Times](/video-metadata/YouTube-threat.md), I do not store important info in video descriptions. I was storing descriptions and scripts in GitHub Gists, but [Gitea](https://about.gitea.com) doesn't allow mirroring Gists and it makes organization and interrelation of different videos/links far more difficult than it needs to be.
