Links are kept outside of my YouTube descriptions after [YouTube threatened me over linking to the New York Times](../YouTube-threat.md):  
1. THE WIKI [https://poohadventures.fandom.com/wiki/Pooh%27s_Adventures_Wiki](https://poohadventures.fandom.com/wiki/Pooh%27s_Adventures_Wiki)
2. After writing/recording, I found a better tool for exporting a full wiki: [https://github.com/WikiTeam/wikiteam](https://github.com/WikiTeam/wikiteam) (it's a little hard to use though, because it relies on deprecated technology)
3. Page export is at [Special:Export](https://poohadventures.fandom.com/wiki/Special:Export) and the all pages are listed from [Special:AllPages](https://poohadventures.fandom.com/wiki/Special:AllPages).
4. There's also a bulk export at [Special:Statistics](https://poohadventures.fandom.com/wiki/Special:Statistics).
5. A decent introduction to the wiki: [The Crossover Hell of Pooh's Adventures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QItdZoWyzg) by [That Yozzy Bloke](https://www.youtube.com/@ThatYozzyBloke)
6. [Torren](https://www.youtube.com/@torren5950) makes cool Animorphs videos. And cool other videos.
7. (a brief badly done "what the fuck" - this is where one of the quotes at the end comes from because it's no longer on the wiki) [Journey through the Pooh's Adventures Wiki](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6e9NSE1TQI) by [Max Goes Fourth](https://www.youtube.com/@MaxGoesFourth)

Using wikiteam, I archived as much as possible, and the last line recorded before Fandom pulled the plug was:

```
Thread:Yru17/@comment-24574037-20160831052007, 1 edit
```

I will try to get this uploaded to archive.org asap.

## Script

Pooh's Adventures Wiki. We all know it, we all love it. Where else will you read about a sentient train being enslaved by a princess while dating a pony, or the millions of cousins of Christopher Robin?

Unfortunately, there has been some really sad news. Fandom decided that Pooh's multiversal shenanigans is just too ambitious for their website, and is shutting it down. There was a spark of hope that wiki.gg would take over, but they're scared of our power too.

That's okay though, through the power of MediaWiki, Pooh's Adventures shall **live**! I don't know how to make sure all of the media gets saved, because archiving webpages is slow, but I can at least save the text.

But hey, you only have a few days to save the images from your favorite characters, like Tobias, Tobias (oh wait, that one doesn't have images), Tobias, Tobias, or Tobias.

You don't get good art without a lot of bad art. There's something beautiful about even the most unhinged combination of things being thrown together for fun. I don't remember what video I saw this quote in (it's probably Abigail Thorne's Philosophy Tube or Lindsay Ellis or some other woman who makes media analysis videos), but it's apt:

> The whole point of fanfiction is that you get to play inside somebody else's universe. Rewrite the rules. Or bend them. The story doesn't have to end. You can stay in this world, this world you love, as long as you want, as long as you keep thinking of new stories.
> \- Rainbow Rowell

So like.. enjoy this while it lasts, and save what you think is funny or interesting from it. That's *why* I'm saving the whole wiki's text, and making a short shitposty video about it.

By the way, I blame Torren for me stumbling across this wiki. I will not explain why or how other than it has to do with Torren talking about Tobias in one of these videos. Tobias is actually the most important character in all of fiction and I will not be elaborating.

Also it's important to ship Twilight Sparkle and Thomas the Tank Engine.
