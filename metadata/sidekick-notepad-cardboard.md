## Script

(As you can probably tell, this is one video where I followed the script the least. :D)

This is the Sidekick Notepad, by Cortex. The idea is to make it very easy to keep track of important notes without distractions. The problem is that I'm poor, and can't afford (interrupt) it.

Oh, wow, they just released a bunch more versions of it too. That's so cool. A calendar, a planner, and (interrupt) blank space here.

Um, what was I talking about? Oh, right, I'm poor! So poor that I recently screwed up keeping my data safe and lost almost everything I had, because I can't afford convenient backup services. They cost money.

So I made my own! To be honest, I didn't really think I'd make a video about this, but I was so proud of myself for being clever and thrifty with my lack of income that I figured I should share. There's no way I'm the only one who wants this but can't afford it.

That first image put it in the most flattering light, so here's a little bit more realistic a perspective. Some of my local libraries offer free printing, and I had access to the rest. I think these materials are fairly commonly available, so this should help anyone who wants to try it. Just print, cut, staple, and then cover the staples with tape so you don't poke yourself with it.

Now, since I just made this, I haven't had a chance to see if it actually helps me, but hey, that's what experimenting is for.

The biggest problem I ran into was waste. I do not like wasting anything, but especially paper. I dunno why, I'm just like that.

So while I haven't tried it yet, I did make a template to make it thinner, make two pages from every sheet of paper, and not waste any paper at all! I also gave myself markers for where to cut, staple, and tape so that it's easier to put together.

Hey, did you know that I share a lot of my notes publicly, even when they're not finished? I stole the idea from Nicole van der Hoeven, whose name I presume I missaid, even though I did try to say it correctly.. Anyhow, there's a link in the description to my notes.

I discovered emoji and now I can't stop putting them in things. Help.
