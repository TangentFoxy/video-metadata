## Script
Does this website say "unstable alpha software, use at your own risk" to you? It doesn't to me.

Does this say "data loss is likely" or "uses highly customized and non-standard formatting" to you? Me neither.

I'm mad, because I was misled into believing Logseq is safe and stable software that I can use for notes. See, Obsidian recently pushed an update that broke my everything, and I've spent the past week and a half just trying to pick up the pieces, so I've been looking for other options. Logseq appears highly polished and similar in functionality, but it's not.

While the GitHub releases do warn about Logseq being beta software, nowhere else is the user warned. And the first experience you'll meet is very disorienting, with nothing indicating the risk of data loss when you change the date format.

On top of this, there is a worse issue lurking. For 3 years now, Logseq's publication features have been leaking private information, with no response from the developers on this issue. The impact of this issue is somewhat lessened by it not being a feature that automatically serves the output to the internet like Obsidian's Publish feature, but it is still dangerous and nothing warns the user about this. I shouldn't have to explain why privacy violations are a huge problem, but if you want a good example of how someone's life can be permanently harmed by it, I've put a link in the description.

While Logseq supports using git to backup and sync files, it warns that this is risky, but blames git for that, when it is causing git repos to be corrupted for at least one user, and causing other git-related errors. They also have their own sync system, but it doesn't support having Logseq open on multiple devices, and can cause you to have to re-index things manually - which causes data loss.

Logseq does not indicate what has been saved and what is unsaved, and expects you to know what will happen when you click the Refresh or Re-index buttons. Both of these buttons have caused data loss for years, and continue to do so.

Logseq doesn't seem to have data integrity as a core principle, and is not ready for usage, despite advertising itself as a functioning product.

What it says on the slide. I am recovering from not having an income for 1.5 years and could use the help. Have a great day!
