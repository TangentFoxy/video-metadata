YouTube [threatened to file a strike against my channel for linking to the New York Times](https://github.com/TangentFoxy/video-metadata/blob/main/YouTube-threat.md)
in my video's description, so I moved all source information elsewhere to avoid this problem
happening again. This will be how I publish videos from now on.

Sources (appearing directly in this video, in order):
- First paper (room temperature superconductor): https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12008v1
- Second paper (quantum levitation): https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12037v1

Sources (not in video, but providing important context!):
- Learn about diamagnetism you cretin! https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamagnetism
- Paper showing LK-99 superconductivity is possible: https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16892v1
- NY Times interviews author of that paper: https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/03/science/lk-99-superconductor-ambient.html

There are many more sources to read that are important. There is also conflicting information abound.
I have lost some of the sources I wished to link here.
